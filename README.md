# MTPE-Lab2
This is upgraded program from the first lab. Here i added new features like now you can use my code to convert md to ansi sequences and also i added unit tests with Jest. To run this program you need to intall it from my repo and then write npm install to intall Jest and then in terminal you need to type name of your md file and then you get converted ansi code in console if you want to get ansi in a file then add flags --format ansi and --out <nameOfYourFile>. To run test just write npm test in terminal. [Link on failed test in CI](https://github.com/TarasBlatnoi/MTPE-Lab2/actions/runs/8481755397). In my opinion unit tests helped to structure my code and change logic of my code to make it look cleaner also with tests i can check whether i broke some other functionality or not because for example with tests when i changed my code i saw that when i changed one feature the other one was broken so i had to revise my code. So i would say that unit tests helped pretty much.
